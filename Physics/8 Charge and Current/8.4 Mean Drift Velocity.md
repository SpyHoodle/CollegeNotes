# Mean Drift Velocity
2022-11-23 | [8 Charge and Current](8%20Charge%20and%20Current.md)

## Metals
- On average for every atom there is one conduction electron
- **Number Density** (n) -> The number of conduction electrons per unit volume
	- For copper, n is approximately $10^{29} \text{m}^{-3}$

## Equation for Current
- $I = Anev$
	- $A$ is the cross sectional area
	- $n$ is the number density of the material
	- $v$ is the mean drift velocity of the charge carriers
	- $e$ is the charge of the charge carrier (for a wire an electron's charge)

## Mean Drift Velocity
- Copper atoms are continuously vibrating
- Electrons collide with the vibrating atoms and will cause it to slow down
- The conduction electron then accelerates in the same direction until it collides with another copper atom
- The mean drift velocity is slow due to the haphazard nature of the motion
- Smaller cross sectional area means a higher drift velocity as current is the same in a series circuit

| Material      | Approx value of $n$ | Mean drift velocity |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Metal         | $10^{28}$           | $2 \times 10^{-5}$  |
| Semiconductor | $10^{17}$           | $1 \times 10^{-11}$ |
| Insulator     | $10^3$              | $1 \times 10^{-31}$ |

### Proportionality
- $v = \frac{I}{\pi r^2 ne}$
- $\therefore v \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$
	- This is an inverse square law

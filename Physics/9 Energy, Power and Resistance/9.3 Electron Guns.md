## The Process
- A small metal filament at the rear of the gun is heated by an electric current
- The electrons in this filament gain sufficient energy to escape from the surface of the metal (**thermionic emission**)
- There is a large potential difference between the filament and the (positive) anode
- This causes electrons to accelerate towards the anode
- A small gap in the anode allows electrons to pass through and be fired out of the gun

## Conservation of Energy Equation
- $eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = E_k$
	- Assumes that the electrons have negligible kinetic energy at the cathode
	- The greater the potential difference the greater the kinetic energy and hence the greater the velocity

## Compilers
- Translates code into machine code, then the program is ran

### Stages
1. **Lexical** -> Removes white-spaces and comments, parts the computer doesn't need
2. **Syntax** -> Applies the rules of the programming language, checks for syntax errors
3. **Semantic** -> Checks for improper use of the programming language, such as undefined variables
4. **Code generation** -> Generates the machine code once all errors that prevent the code from running have been checked

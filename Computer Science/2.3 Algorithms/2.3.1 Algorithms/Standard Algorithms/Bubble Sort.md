- Complexity measured by number of comparisons and swaps in comparison to the size of the list

## Order
- Compare each pair of adjacent elements
- If they are not in the correct order then swap the elements
- If they are in the correct order then do no swap elements
- When you read the end of the array return to the start
- Repeat n elements time
- Set a flag to be false whenever a swap is made
- â€¦repeat the loop if the flag is not false

# Resistivity of a Wire
2023-02-13 | [PAGs](PAGs.md)

## Aim
- To find the resistivity of a wire of constantan, and to get the same result as the value we are expecting from Georgia State University [(1)](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/rstiv.html)

## Equipment
- 3V DC Power Supply
- Ammeter (we used a multimeter)
- Voltmeter (we used a multimeter)
- 2m of constantan wire
- Wires and crocodile clips
- Metre rule (we used 2 metre rules attached to the constantan)

## Method

> Figure 1: A diagram of our circuit

- We setup the diagram as shown in Figure 1
- For the potentiometer we used a constantan wire of typical resistivity of $4.9 \times 10^{-7}  \ohm \text{m}$ [(1)](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/rstiv.html)
- We then varied the length of the wire using crocodile clips, and recorded the p.d across the wire and current in the circuit
- We measured the length of the wire by using a metre rule which was attached to the wire so that it was easy for us to measure with less uncertainty 
- We repeated this multiple times going up in 0.1 metres from 0 to 2 metres

> Table 1: What we measured for current and potential difference, and calculated for resistance, against each value for the length of the wire

- We calculated the resistance of length of wire by using the equation $R = \frac{V}{I}$ in Apple Numbers

### Graph

> Figure 2: A graph of resistance against the length of wire
- We plotted a graph of the calculated resistance (Ω) against the length of the write (m) by using Apple Numbers
- From the equation $R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$, our $y$ values are $R$ and our $x$ values are $L$
-  Rearranging to the form $y = mx + c$
	- $R = \frac{\rho}{A}L + 0$
	- Our y-intercept $c$, should be close to zero however we got a value of $1.4129$. This is likely due to the internal resistance of the power supply and resistance of crocodile clips and the wires from the clips to the power supply
	- Our gradient $m$, is $\frac{\rho}{A}$ which means that to get the resistivity we needed to multiply the gradient by the cross sectional area of the wire

### Resistivity
- To get the cross-sectional area, we used a micrometer to measure the diameter of the wire
- We got that the diameter was $2.6750 \times 10^{-4} \text{m}$
- Using the area of a circle formula, we got that: $\text{Area} = \pi (\frac{d}{2})^{2}= \pi (\frac{2.675 \times 10^{-4}}{2})^{2} = 5.62 \times 10^{-8} \text{m}^{2}$
- We then calculated the resistivity of the wire by multiplying the gradient of the line with the cross sectional area of the wire in Apple Numbers as $5.13 \times 10^{-7} \ohm \text{m}$ with an uncertainty due to equipment of $0.18\%$
- Using Apple Numbers to calculate uncertainty, this was $4.6\%$ off our expected value from [Georgia State University (1)](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Tables/rstiv.html)

## Error
- Our uncertainty calculations were much lower than how far off we were from our expected value
- The power supply and extra wires with crocodile clips could have likely had some internal resistance that meant the reading for current was lower than it would have been theoretically without extra resistances
- There was likely fluctuations in our readings due to the wire's temperature increasing, to mitigate this we turned the power supply off after every reading however this may have not been enough as we were taking readings one after another
- The temperature of the room could have been different, meaning the resistance of the wire will be different than the readings from Georgia State University
- The alloy used at Georgia State University could have been slightly different to our constantan alloy as they may have used a higher quality alloy with potentially different percentages of metals
- The distances of the length of wire could have been slightly different as we have to measure with our eyes, however we did try to mitigate this by attaching the constatan wire to the rules and using two separate 1m lengths of wire

## Risks
| Risk                     | Those at risk           | Actions taken                                                                                            | Risk Score |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| Fire due to wire melting | Everyone                | Checking temperature of wire with fingers and turning off power supply after each reading to reduce heat | 2 x 2 = 4  |
| Wire heat causing burns  | Us doing the experiment | Same as above                                                                                            | 1 x 2 = 1           |

## Conclusion
- We were very close to our expected value, only missing it by just $4.6\%$ meaning our experiment to find the resistivity of a constantan wire was successful

## Resistance
- When a battery is connected across a piece of metal, a potential difference is produced across it
	- This makes the conduction electrons move through it
	- These electrons collide with each other and the atoms of the metal
	- Collisions slow down and restrict the movement of electrons (**resistance**)
	- Increasing the temperature increases the resistance as positive ions of the metal vibrate more creating more collisions with electrons

## Ohm's Law
- **Ohm's Law** -> The potential difference across a conductor is directly proportional to the current in the component as long as its temperature remains constant
- $V = IR$
	- $\ohm = \text{V A}^{-1}$

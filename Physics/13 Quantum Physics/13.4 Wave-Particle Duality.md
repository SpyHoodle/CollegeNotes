## Electron Diffraction
- Diffraction is a wave property
- Electrons from an electron gun are accelerated by an applied p.d. and hit a thin layer of graphite
- The atomic spacing of the carbon atoms is similar to the wavelength of electrons so diffraction occurs
- The graphite atoms are not lined up in the same direction (many orientations) so a circular pattern is formed #COMMONQUESTION 

## de Broglie Wavelength
- The wavelength associated with a moving particle such as an electron
- $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$
	- Where $p = mv$
- For particles use de Brogile not $c = f \lambda$

### Other Related Equations
- $eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ is often used to find the velocity of the particle
- $n \lambda = d \sin{\theta}$ from Year 2 cosmology

- **Number of Cores** -> The more cores a computer has the more processes it can run at once, meaning more programs can be run simultaneously
- **Cache** -> Quick access memory that sits between main memory and the CPU to speed up operations that happen all the time
	- It is extremely fast and only contains a few MB to keep the speed fast
- **Clock speed** -> The higher the speed of the clock, the more operations can be run in the same second
- **Instruction pipelining** -> Breaking a task into smaller steps which can then be completed one after another handled independently

# Testing to Inform Evaluation
2023-01-06 | [3.4 Evaluation](3.4%20Evaluation.md)

## Testing Types
- **Integration Testing** -> where individual modules or units that have already been separately tested are tested whilst together to ensure that they are compatible and function as expected together
- **White Box Testing** (structural testing) -> checking all the pathways through the code to make sure that it will work in every circumstance, no matter how unlikely the pathway will be used
	- 'White box' -> you have to see the code
	- Each test is designed to illuminate something new and not duplicate insights gained from other tests
- **Black Box Testing** -> testing that is focused on functionality - the tests will check that the system does what it is supposed to do without checking how it has been coded
	- 'Black box' -> you don't see the code
	- Test data is entered through the user interface and the output is viewed in the way it would be displayed to the end user
- **Stress Testing** -> testing to make sure that the system can handle the anticipated volume of users or data
- **Alpha Testing** -> the final testing that is carried out using documented test plans by the development team
- **Beta Testing** -> unstructured testing by a range of selected end users - allows the system to be tested on a wide range of hardware and software
- **Iterative Testing** -> testing that is carried out at every stage of development, the programmer writes an individual section of code and then it is tested
- **Final Testing** -> testing that is carried out once the program or system is considered to be completely finished and is the last phase of testing
- **Acceptance Testing** -> the final testing with the intended users, often involving scenarios that the users follow to make sure that the system meets the requirements specification

## Test Platforms
- **Test Platform** -> version of the system that can be used to test program fixes or new fixes or features without impacting the live system
- There are tools available that can automate various types of testing
- Sometimes separate testing programs are written to carry out complex series of tests

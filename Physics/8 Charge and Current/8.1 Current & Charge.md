# Current and Charge
2022-11-17 | [8 Charge and Current](8%20Charge%20and%20Current.md)

- **Electric Current** -> Rate of flow of charge
	- $I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$ or $Q = It$
- **One coulomb** ($1 \text{A s}$) -> The amount of charge passing a point in an electric circuit in one second when 1 amp is flowing
- $Q = ne$ 
	- Where $n$ is the number of electrons
	- And $e$ is the elementary charge $1.6 \times 10^{-19}$

## Millikan's oil-drop experiment

- JJ Thompson had found the specific charge of an electron from cathode ray experiments, but the actual charge was unknown
- Millikan had found the absolute charge which also meant the mass could be calculated
- He found that the sizes of charges that he measured only had multiples of a particular number
- He concluded that charge is quantised as we can only have integer multiples of the elementary charge
	- $e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19}$

## Method #UNSURE
- As oil drops were sprayed, they were electrically charged due to friction with the nozzle
- While the electric field was turned off, the oil drops were introduced between the plates and fell straight down
- The electric field was turned on, and the oil drops that were charged began to rise
- One suitable drop was selected to stay in the middle by alternately switching off the voltage until the other drops came down
- The drop was then allowed to fall at its terminal velocity

### Stoke's Law
- Drop an object in a fluid
	- ...it experiences a viscous drag force
- This force is in the opposite direction to the velocity 
	- ...and is due to the viscosity of the fluid
- $F = 3 \tau \eta rv$
	- $F$ -> viscous force in $\text{N}$
	- $\eta$ -> viscosity of the fluid in $\text{Pa s}$
	- $v$ -> velocity if the object in $\text{m s}^{-1}$
	- $r$ -> radius of the object in $\text{m}$

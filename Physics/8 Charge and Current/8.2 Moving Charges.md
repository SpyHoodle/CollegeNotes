## Conventional current
- Electrons in reality flow from negative to positive
- However in conventional current we say electrons and charge flow from positive to negative
- This is because it was the agreed convention before electrons were discovered

## Voltmeters and ammeters
- Ammeters have low resistance 
- Voltmeters have a high resistance

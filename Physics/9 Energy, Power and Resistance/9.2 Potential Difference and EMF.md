## Definition of potential difference
- To move a charge around a circuit it requires electrical energy
- This energy is supplied by the power supply or battery, known as the potential difference
- **Potential difference between two points** -> the energy transferred or work done from electrical energy to other forms per unit of charge
- $V = \frac{W}{Q}$
	- $V$ is potential difference
	- $W$ is work done or energy transferred
	- $Q$ is charge
- **One volt** -> The potential difference produced when a charge of one coulomb flows and releases one joule of energy

## Electromotive force (E.M.F.)
- $\epsilon = \frac{W}{Q}$
	- $\epsilon$ is E.M.F.
- Work done on the charge carriers per unit of charge measured across a cell, battery or power supply (known as a source of E.M.F.)
- The work done is transferring energy from chemical if it is a battery to electrical energy

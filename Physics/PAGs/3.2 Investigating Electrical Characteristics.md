> Figure 1: A circuit diagram that we used to investigate the I-V characteristics of components.

1. Jo setup the circuit as shown in *Figure 1*. The first component we used was a resistor.
	 - For the ammeter we used a multi-meter set to max $20\text{mA}$
	 - For the voltmeter we used a multi-meter set to max $20\text{V}$
2. We then set the power supply to $1V$, and recorded the current and p.d. reading on the multi-meters for every integer value from $1V$ to $13V$ (on the power supply)
3. We would then swap the wires over on the power supply to test the negative values of potential difference for each component
4. We then repeated these steps for a filament bulb and an LED, however set the ammeter to max $200mA$ as the LED had higher current readings

## Precautions
- We wanted to prevent the multi-meters fuses from melting, so we were careful and set the multi-meter to the correct settings
	- We began by using the $10A$ setting on the ammeter, and when showing zero then we used the $200mA$ setting then $20mA$ if the readings of current were too small
- We also wanted the resistors and filament bulbs to not get too hot and melt, so we periodically checked their temperature with our fingers
	- If they got too hot we would have let them cool down before taking other measurements, so that they didn't melt or affect our further results

## Results

> Table 1: Results of potential difference against current for every component we tested

- With Apple Numbers, we inputted the results as seen in *Table 1*
- We then used a simple `*0.001` formula for the column of currents to get the current from $\text{mA}$ to $\text{A}$ ready to draw the graphs
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Graphs
- We then used Numbers to plot graphs of each component for potential difference (V) plotted against current (A)
- We then drew a trend line over the graph with Numbers and calculated a gradient and y-intercept for each set of data (also with Numbers)
- The uncertainty shown on the graphs were correct, as they came from the amount of decimal places on the multi-meters (as it will round the last decimal place)

### Equation
- Using the equation $V = IR$ rearranged to the graph is: $I = \frac{V}{R} \therefore I \propto \frac{1}{R}$
	- This is because p.d. is the independent variable, so that must be our $x$ value
- This tells us that the gradient is $\frac{1}{R}$, the reciprocal of the resistance of the component
- The y-intercept should be as close to zero as possible

#### Resistor

> Figure 2: A graph of p.d plotted against current for our resistor results

- We found the gradient of the red trend line to be $1.994 \times 10^{-5}$. Taking the reciprocal gives us a resistance of: $\frac{1}{1.994 \times 10^{-5}} = 50.2 \text{k}\ohm \textit{ (3 s.f.)}$
- The resistor had an actual resistance of $46.4\text{k}\ohm$
	- So we were very close to the resistor's actual resistance
	- We determined the actual resistance by using an ohmmeter on the resistor

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Filament Bulb
![2023-01-18-pag-3.2-filament-bulb-graph](2023-01-18-pag-3.2-filament-bulb-graph.jpeg)
> Figure 3: A graph of p.d plotted against current for our filament bulb results 

- The shape of the graph is what we expected, as the potential difference gets higher the gradient decreases
	- This is because the filament bulb gets hotter, which means resistance increases which therefore decreases the increase of current
- The reciprocal of the gradient of the red trend line tells us the resistance of the filament bulb should be around: $\frac{1}{0.0082} = 120 \ohm \textit{ (2 s.f.)}$
	- However we cannot confirm this as we don't know the actual resistance of the filament bulb

#### LED
![2023-01-18-pag-3.2-diode-graph](2023-01-18-pag-3.2-diode-graph.jpeg)
> Figure 3: A graph of p.d plotted against current for our LED results 

- As expected with the LED, there is no current flowing through the circuit (an ammeter reading of $0 \text A$) when the current is flowing through the opposite way through the LED
	- This was when we swapped the wires on the power supply, giving a negative potential difference
	- This is because the LED is a diode, meaning it has an incredibly high resistance (practically infinite) one way
- After this, the graph was directly proportional, as the LED doesn't get hotter so resistance doesn't increase, which means the gradient stays the same

## Conclusion
- Our graphs were correct, and we completed the experiment with decent accuracy
- We got results that we were expecting, showing our method was accurate

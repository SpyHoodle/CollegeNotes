# I-V Characteristics
2022-12-05 | [9 Energy, Power and Resistance](9%20Energy,%20Power%20and%20Resistance.md)

- **Ohmic conductor** -> A component where the current is directly proportional to the p.d.
	- **Non-ohmic** -> Not directly proportional

## Practical
- An experimental setup as shown can be used to investigate the I-V characteristics of a component (rheostat = variable resistor)
